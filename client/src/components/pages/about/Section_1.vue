               XRB is a proof-of-concept web-hosting and data-visualisation tool proposed to the NSF by Dr. Richard Plotkin and Dr. Sergiu Dascalu et al. It is designed, developed, and published on behalf of the University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Physics and the University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Computer Science and Engineering and shall be made publicly available for academic research and education. Our team has designed and implemented support for two-dimensional data-visualisations, full-feature plots and displays, linear regression, data-mining processes, dataset I/O, dataset hosting, user authentication, and user-group management.
