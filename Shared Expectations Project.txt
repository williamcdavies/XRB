        - Refer to the styleguide for tool-specific expectations
        
        Note: Pandas will be used as the primary visualisation tool until replaced. A front-facing database is disallowed.

Documentation Expectations:
        - Every function must be documented
        - Function documentation must include a use-case description, parameters description, and outputs description
        - Function documentation must be formally typed
        - Strive for professionalism

Testing Expectations:
        - Branches are required to pass a full-feature test prior to pull request
        - Every pull request must be reviewed by at least two contributors
        - If any feature breaks post merge, every contributor must inspect the failure and contribute to its resolution
        - Every commit must be of the form: <infinitive> <context> to <reason>. e.g., Add feature to component to support non-functional requirement #123. If the reason statement is reasonably long, transition the statement to the description box.
        
Timeline:
- Nov. 15 - Prototype v0
        Setup Ubuntu Server (Will), setup monorepo for all main tool usage (Will), integrate actions/docker (Jake), implement data cleaning solution (Ethan), implement default visualizations with Pandas (Ethan).
